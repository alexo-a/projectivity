<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Projectivity is a lean, clean, productivity machine.  Built to be a clean, simple time-tracking app for project management, Projectivity simplifies project management by giving users a single place to track their time for multiple projects in one single location. Each project is broken down into multiple tasks that can be assigned to one or more users. Users are then able to log time for a task. When desired, users can view a report of their work the current week. Managers for a project can see progress reports for the entire length of the project at any time.
